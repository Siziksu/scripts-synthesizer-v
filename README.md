# Dreamtonics Synthesizer V Scripts

## SiziksuMoveNotes

Current version: `1.01`

This script is used to move all or a selection of notes of the current track. You can choose to also include the parameters and, with them, the vocal modes of your choice.

Value:

The value is related to a quarter note. So, if the value is `1.25`, it means you want to move forward a quarter note plus a sixteenth note. If the value is negative, it will move backwards.

Options:

- Move all track notes without the parameter points
- Move the notes of a selection without the parameter points
- Move all track notes along with their parameter points
- Move the notes of a selection along with their parameter points

When selecting to move parameters, you can also include the Voice Modes of your choice by typing them separated by commas.

### Added in 1.01

- Move relative to the playhead (ignores selection if present)
